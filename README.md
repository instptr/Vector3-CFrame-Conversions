# Vector3-CFrame-Conversions
Converted C++ code to Python implementations of Roblox's Vector3 and CFrame classes. These classes are used for 3D mathematical operations such as vector addition, subtraction, multiplication and dot product, as well as operations related to Euler angles, axis angle rotation and point to screen space.
